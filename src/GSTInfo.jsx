            <b>GST: A Comprehensive Indirect Tax Reform</b>

          <p className="m-0 font-medium">
            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a comprehensive, multi-stage,
            destination-based tax levied on the supply of goods and services in
            India. Introduced on July 1, 2017, GST replaced multiple indirect
            taxes levied by the central and state governments. GST aims to
            create a common national market, improve tax compliance, and reduce
            the overall tax burden on consumers. It has simplified the tax
            structure, making it easier for businesses to comply with tax laws.

            The GST Council, chaired by the Union Finance Minister and
            comprising state finance ministers, is responsible for making
            recommendations on various aspects of GST, including tax rates,
            exemptions, and rules.
